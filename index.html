            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                So Beyonce is in a difficult position. She desperately needs to spend those early hours of the morning writing the Harry Potter fan fiction, but the workflow is making this whole project more stressful than stress relief. Frustrated, she turns to her information security professional friend, Taylor Swift.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taylor Swift, as an information security professional and award winning singer-songwriter, immediately knows the perfect answer to their problem, and she suggests to Beyoncé that they use Git to manage their book.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyoncé has no idea what that is. Do any of you know?
              </p>
              <p>
                [answers]
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately Beyoncé didn't have anyone as useful as all of you to hand, she just had Taylor Swift, who as a lyricist can speak a little cryptically sometimes. So when Beyoncé asked 'what do you mean by Git?', Taylor Swift replied: 'ask man'. Beyoncé of course was like - what? Ask a man? Do you mean Jay-Z, because he is terrible with computers. And Taylor Swift clarified - no, no, don't ask a man, and especially don't ask Jay-Z. When you want more information about a command line program or command, you can get access to the manual pages by typing in 'man' and then the thing you're confused about.
              </p>
              <p>
                So Beyoncé goes home and she types into her terminal: `man git`.
              </p>
              <p>
                [go to terminal] And she reads: Git - the stupid content tracker.
              </p>
              <p>
                She isn't super sold on the idea. It all seems a bit complicated, and it does describe itself as stupid. But it turns out that Kim Kardashian, Harry Potter super fan, is actually quite comfortable with Git and already has a GitHub account which she uses to contribute to open source software.
              </p>
              <p>
                So Kim creates a repository on GitHub for their fan fiction. Beyoncé *clones* the repository onto her computer and starts writing into fanfiction.md again. 
              </p>
              <p>
                So unlike the systems they tried earlier, saving the document doesn't automatically propagate it to the server. Beyoncé is actually really pleased about this - it means she can
